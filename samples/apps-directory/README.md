## Summary

**Apps directory** is a **SharePoint Copilot App** built as an SPFx 1.24 **Copilot Component** (not a classic web part). It brings your organisation's full application catalogue into Microsoft 365 Copilot. Browse apps by category, search by name or keyword, mark your most-used apps as favourites for quick access, and launch any app directly from the Copilot chat. You can also add custom app shortcuts and filter the directory to show only your personal favourites.

The same React component renders in two modes inside the Copilot canvas:

- a compact **inline** tile grid showing your pinned favourites, and
- an immersive **full-screen** view with a **categories panel** and a **favourites panel** side by side.

Favourites and custom apps are **persisted to the user's OneDrive** (via Microsoft Graph) so the personalisation roams across devices and sessions.

The sample ships with **mocked data** so anyone can deploy and demo in minutes. The mock app list is served through a swappable `getMockApps()` function, ready to be replaced by a live SharePoint list or Microsoft Graph data source without touching the UI.
