## Summary

**Zava Retail Store** is a **SharePoint Copilot App** built as an SPFx 1.24 **Copilot Component** (not a classic web part). Copilot opens to a compact performance card — key metrics and a sales trend — then expands to a full executive dashboard covering sales, category mix, customer satisfaction, feedback, top products and store comparisons. Maximum impact for a retail launch demo.

The same React component renders in two modes inside the Copilot canvas:

- a compact **inline** card, and
- an immersive **full-screen** executive dashboard.

The sample ships with **mocked data** so anyone can deploy and demo in minutes — no line-of-business integration required. A swappable data service exposes a `useMock` flag (`true` for offline demos, `false` to read a live data service and Microsoft Graph for the signed-in user).

## Minimal Path to Awesome

> **Ready-made package included.** Because this is a scenario sample that runs entirely on mock data - with no live customer data or line-of-business integration - the repository ships the fully built solution package so you can deploy and demo it in minutes without building anything. Grab the package here: [/sharepoint/solution/zava-retail-store.sppkg](./sharepoint//solution/zava-retail-store.sppkg).
>
> To use it, upload `zava-retail-store.sppkg` to your tenant **App Catalog**, enable solution in all sites (includes Copilot), and invoke the agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Prefer to build from source instead? Follow the steps below.

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder (`zava-retail-store`)
- In the command-line run:
  - `npm install -g @rushstack/heft`
  - `npm install`
  - `heft start --clean` — local dev server at `https://localhost:4321`
- Invoke the agent in Copilot and confirm the inline render, expand-to-full-screen, and dark/light theming.

Production build, test, and package:

```bash
npm run build
```

Other build commands can be listed using `heft --help`.

## 60-second demo script

A tight, repeatable flow for a live demo. All data is mock, so it works the same every time.

1. **Invoke it** - in Microsoft 365 Copilot, select the **ZavaRetail Agent** agent and send: _"Show me the performance of our store in New York"_ The compact **inline card** renders.
2. **Land the inline experience** (~10s) - call out the initial output with brief recap of performance (today's sales, customer satisfaction, sales trend, and top category).
3. **Expand** (~10s) - click the **Open full dashboard** command on the lower part of the card. The **full-screen dashboard** animates in - sales vs target, transactions, avg basket, CSAT, NPS, conversion rate, sales trend, sales by category, customer satisfaction, top products today, recent customer feedback, and store/region comparison.
4. **The "wow" moment** (~30s) - click **Filters**. Select the target store, target date, and enabled/disable any of the components/charts rendering in the dashboard. The whole dashboard dynamically updates accordingly to your settings.
5. **Theming** (~10s) - flip the Copilot host to **dark mode** to show the whole experience re-theme instantly.

> Tip: the day is always "today" and data follows current calendar, whenever you demo.

## Features

Zava Retail Store demonstrates how to build a rich, theme-aware executive dashboard inside the Microsoft 365 Copilot canvas using an SPFx Copilot Component.

This sample illustrates the following concepts:

- **Copilot Component UX** — a `CopilotComponent` (`copilotType: "UX"`) surfaced as a tool (`ZavaRetailTool`) a declarative agent can call, rendering its own React UI inside the Copilot host.
- **Display-mode-aware rendering** — a single root React component (`ZavaRetailApp`) selects a dedicated **inline** or **full-screen** view from the host-advertised display mode; inline can request expansion to full screen.
- **Swappable data service** — Microsoft Graph + data service access behind a `useMock` flag, with mock data fallback for fully offline demos.
- **Theme awareness** — light/dark theme driven by the Copilot host context and Fluent UI v9 (`webLightTheme` / `webDarkTheme`).

### UX components

Metrics row · sales trend line chart · sales-by-category · satisfaction gauge · customer feedback · product carousel · store comparison · sparklines

### Inline experience

Compact performance card — headline metrics plus a sales trend at-a-glance summary, with a control to expand into the full dashboard.

### Full-screen experience

Executive dashboard shell (app rail + top bar) composed of modular sections: metrics row, sales trend panel, sales by category, customer satisfaction, customer feedback, top-products carousel and store comparison — plus a settings dialog for data source and theme.

### Wireframe

```text
INLINE  🏬 Zava Retail — Seattle   ▲ Sales $128.4k   ◔ CSAT 4.6   ▸ Expand dashboard

FULL    ┌ Metrics row ───────────────┐
        ├ Sales trend ┤├ Categories ┤├ Satisfaction ◔ ┤
        ├ Feedback ───┤├ Top products carousel ┤├ Store comparison ┤
```

## Data source

Microsoft Graph (`/me`, `/me/photo` for the signed-in user); retail metrics, categories, feedback and product catalog from a data service. All data is **mocked** for the sample via a swappable data service (`useMock` flag); set `useMock` to `"false"` and provide a `dataServiceUrl` to read live data.
